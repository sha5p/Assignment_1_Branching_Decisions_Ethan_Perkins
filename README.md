Part 1. Research games with branching decisions or systems that create different
player experiences
Before creating your game, you will need to investigate the properties and features of
existing games which fit into this category. You need to compare these two games (or
more).
You need to summarise their purposes, describe the component features of these games
and what these component features aim to do. You need to critically analyse each game

based on the design principles, and show which games you are drawing inspiration from
for your own experience.

**Research Game Comparision**  -note add refrences

For this game Research I will be comparing three diffrent types of branching decisions from Fianl Fantasy XVI, Soul Knight and Stellaris. Final Fantasy games popular for their story lines and how they can be progressed in many ways with branching decisions through dialogue effecting how chracters interact with the player and as a result effecting the ending. Addtional Final Fantasy XVI uses a branching upgrade system commenly refered to as a 'skill tree' that allows for the user to choose how they interact with the enemys with 'power ups'. Soul Knight a top down rouge like is less story line driven and leaves more up to the players choices giving them a shop system as well as a skill tree to use while navigating throughout the levels (Aaron, 2024). Stellaris is a real-time strategy game in which unlike the other games everything is up to the player every decision they make will affect the game from the race they choose to how they manage their resoures, relationships and their current 'fleet' like the pieces they have in chess. To compare these games the following table was made

|Compared|Fianl Fantasy XVI|Soul Knight|Stellaris|

|Branching choices|Has 'Branching' affecting how the user interacts with the game using a skill tree and shop and a shop|Its branching is the main 'choice' that the user must make not following a story line with a dungon system|Stellaris is like giant chess where everything from forming relsonships choosing your chracter and your fleet is a bracnhing choice branching choices is the game|
|Type of game|An RPG game orientating around a story with branching dicsions to progress|A rouge like with choices effecting how the user intreacts with enemys|a relasonship and stratgey game in which the user makes decisions that is the game all about choices|

**Conclusion**
Taking All these diffrent games into account 
Planning & Design the Game
