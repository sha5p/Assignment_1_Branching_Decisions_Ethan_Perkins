**Research Game Comparision**  -note add refrences

For this game Research I will be comparing three diffrent types of branching decisions from Fianl Fantasy XVI, Soul Knight and Stellaris. Final Fantasy games popular for their story lines and how they can be progressed in many ways with branching decisions through dialogue effecting how chracters interact with the player and as a result effecting the ending. Addtional Final Fantasy XVI uses a branching upgrade system commenly refered to as a 'skill tree' that allows for the user to choose how they interact with the enemys with 'power ups'. Soul Knight a top down rouge like is less story line driven and leaves more up to the players choices giving them a shop system as well as a skill tree to use while navigating throughout the levels (Aaron, 2024). Stellaris is a real-time strategy game in which unlike the other games everything is up to the player every decision they make will affect the game from the race they choose to how they manage their resoures, relationships and their current 'fleet' like the pieces they have in chess. To compare these games the following table was made
